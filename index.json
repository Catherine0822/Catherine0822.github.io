[{"categories":["UX Research"],"contents":"Research Background  Although older adults had higher negative attitudes toward robots than younger adults, their acceptance toward robots could be enhanced after direct interaction with robots (Chien et al, 2019). Mere observation of a model’s responses had a facilitatory effect on participants\u0026rsquo; reactions in immediate social influence setting (Bandura, 1961). In computer learning, behavior modeling yielded better training outcomes than other methods such as lecture-based instruction (Yi, M. Y., \u0026amp; Davis, F. D., 2003 ).  Goal of this study  We aimed to investigate possible alternative options ─ other than direct interaction ─ to enhance older adults’ acceptance toward robots.  Methods   80 participants  40 younger adults, 40 older adults 20 people / group    Participants watched video for 3 min  Observational learning (Someone interacted with robot) Control (Robot introduced its function alone)     Measures  Trait curiosity questionnaire Big Five Personality Test Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) State curiosity questionnaire Implicit association task (IAT) perceptual matching task Subjective Technology Adaptivity Inventory (STAI)    Stimuli Two identical films with only difference in interaction with human or not\n interaction video (Click to watch) no interaction video (Click to watch)  Results   The effect of observational learning appeared after direct interaction with the robot: The observational group showed higher scores in perceived safety of technology (PST) in STAI.\n  Participants with higher score in UTAUT were more willing to stay and to interact with the robot.\n  3. In the observational learning group, participants with higher state curiosity also had higher use intention toward the robot.\nRegardless of age and video type, the D1 score of IAT declined after watching the video. The result implied that the implicit attitude toward robots could be changed in a short period of time.  References   Yi, M. Y., \u0026amp; Davis, F. D. 2003.
