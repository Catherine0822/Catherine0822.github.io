[{"categories":["UX Research"],"contents":"Research Background  Although older adults had higher negative attitudes toward robots than younger adults, their acceptance toward robots could be enhanced after direct interaction with robots (Chien et al, 2019). Mere observation of a model’s responses had a facilitatory effect on participants\u0026rsquo; reactions in immediate social influence setting (Bandura, 1961). In computer learning, behavior modeling yielded better training outcomes than other methods such as lecture-based instruction (Yi, M. Y., \u0026amp; Davis, F. D., 2003 ).  Goal of this study  We aimed to investigate possible alternative options ─ other than direct interaction ─ to enhance older adults’ acceptance toward robots.  Methods   80 participants  40 younger adults, 40 older adults 20 people / group    Participants watched video for 3 min  Observational learning (Someone interacted with robot) Control (Robot introduced its function alone)     Measures  Trait curiosity questionnaire Big Five Personality Test Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) State curiosity questionnaire Implicit association task (IAT) perceptual matching task Subjective Technology Adaptivity Inventory (STAI)    Stimuli Two identical films with only difference in interaction with human or not\n interaction video (Click to watch) no interaction video (Click to watch)  Results   The effect of observational learning appeared after direct interaction with the robot: The observational group showed higher scores in perceived safety of technology (PST) in STAI.\n  Participants with higher score in UTAUT were more willing to stay and to interact with the robot.\n  3. In the observational learning group, participants with higher state curiosity also had higher use intention toward the robot.\nRegardless of age and video type, the D1 score of IAT declined after watching the video. The result implied that the implicit attitude toward robots could be changed in a short period of time.  References   Yi, M. Y., \u0026amp; Davis, F. D. 2003.

In-depth Interviw: Interview with subjects to find out potential user\u0026rsquo;s needs. We found that most NTU students have uncomfortable biking experiences.\n2. Field study: Observed bicycle users in the campus of NTU. Record the journey.\n3. Group similar behaviors: Wrote down each behaviors observed in the field study on stickers, and classified them in groups. behaviors that were similar would be placed in the same group.\n4. Persona Behavioral Variables: Placed opposite descriptions of each variables on the two side of the scale, and placed every person we oberved during the field study onto every scale. By identifying behavioural variables, we grouped similar people together into types of users. 5. Persona Candidates: By using the result from step 4, we easily create four persona candidates.\n6. Decide Main Persona: Chose one main persona from our persona candidates. The main persona would represent the target users who we wanted the solved problems for.\n7. Stakeholders Map: Wrote down the stakeholders of our main persona. Stakeholders that were more closed to the middle could impact the persoma more. 8.
